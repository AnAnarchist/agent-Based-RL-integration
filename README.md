This is an integration of BDI agents and Reinforcement Learning, based on [Jason](http://jason.sourceforge.net/wp/) (Actually, it is a [JaCaMo](http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/) project).

The basic idea is that a developer could write some plans and let the agent itself learn other plans and use them in a, this not being exclusively for specific ad hoc problems but as
